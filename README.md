The list of Homebrew packages can be found in the `Brewfile`, and you can customize it according to your requirements.

### Tmux

Tmux is a terminal multiplexer that enables you to manage multiple terminal sessions within a single window. It provides a range of features to improve your workflow and productivity. Once installed, you can use Tmux by launching it from the terminal using the `tmux` command.

### Zsh with Zinit

Zsh is a powerful shell that offers extensive customization options and features. It provides an enhanced command-line experience with autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and more. Zinit is a flexible Zsh plugin manager that simplifies the installation and management of Zsh plugins. Once installed, you can switch to Zsh by running the `zsh` command in the terminal.

Once installed, you can launch LunarVim by running the `lvim` command in the terminal.

### NVM and Node.js

NVM (Node Version Manager) is a utility that allows you to install and manage multiple versions of Node.js on your system. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment used for building scalable and high-performance applications. The setup scriptwill not install NVM and Node.js based on your provided configuration details. If you want to include NVM and Node.js installation in your setup, please let me know, and I can guide you on how to modify the script accordingly.

## Additional Configuration

In addition to the applications and tools installed by the setup script, there are a few optional configurations you can perform manually:

- Customize your terminal settings in Alacritty: Open Alacritty and modify the `alacritty.yml` configuration file located in the `~/.config/alacritty` directory. You can adjust the font, colors, and other settings to suit your preferences.
    
- Configure Zsh and Zinit: Zsh and Zinit offer various configuration options. You can customize your Zsh shell by modifying the `.zshrc` file located in the `~/.config/zsh` directory. Additionally, you can manage your Zsh plugins by editing the `.zshrc` file and adding or removing plugins using the Zinit syntax.
